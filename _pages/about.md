<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Jiahao Zhang (张家豪)**, a first-year PhD student in the Machine Learning Department at MBZUAI.

I work on Explainable AI (XAI) as an interactive tool for understanding and steering models, and I evaluate it in AI4Sci settings.

PhD Supervisor: [Prof. Lijie Hu](https://lijie-hu.github.io/)  
Secondary Supervisor: [Prof. Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/)

[Controlling Repetition in Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00782)

**Jiahao Zhang**, Zeqing Zhang, Di Wang, Lijie Hu

Published: 26 Jan 2026; Last Modified: 11 Feb 2026  
Primary Area: applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)

[**arXiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00782) / [**PDF**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.00782.pdf) / [**Code**](https://github.com/JiahaoZhang-Public/Controlling-Repetition-in-Protein-Language-Models)

Protein language models (PLMs) frequently collapse into pathological repetition during generation, which reduces structural confidence and functional viability.
We provide the first systematic study of repetition in PLMs and propose UCCS (Utility-Controlled Contrastive Steering), a dataset-guided inference-time steering method that reduces repetition while preserving foldability.
