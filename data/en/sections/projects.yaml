- name: Tumor Inference of Causality in EMT Progression
  logo: /images/projects/tic.png
  role: Developer
  timeline: 2025
  url: "https://github.com/cellethology/tic"
  summary: "A computational framework for analyzing cellular micro-environments using graph-based pseudotime analysis and causal inference to study EMT progression in tumors."
  tags: ["academic"]
  description: |
    Tumor Inference of Causality (TIC) integrates tools for graph construction, embedding preparation, pseudotime trajectory computation, and biomarker trend visualization.  
    It enables comprehensive analyses of how cellular states evolve over time and how various factors may influence these trajectories.  
    Key features include:
    - **Pseudotime Ordering:** Infers temporal progression of cellular states.
    - **Causal Inference:** Identifies potential causal relationships affecting cell trajectories.
    - **Open-source Python package** for reproducible biomedical research.

- name: LLM-DepthEval Evaluating GPT-4o for Monocular Depth Estimation
  logo: /images/projects/llm-deptheval.png
  role: Creator
  timeline: 2025
  url: "https://github.com/JiahaoZhang-Public/LLM-DepthEval"
  summary: "An experimental study on GPT-4o’s ability to perform monocular depth estimation without task-specific fine-tuning."
  tags: ["hobby"]
  description: |
    This project explores whether GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM, can estimate depth from single RGB images without explicit monocular depth training.  
    Objectives:
    - Determine if GPT-4o can perform monocular depth estimation without fine-tuning.
    - Explore GPT-4o as a potential implicit **world model** that understands spatial and depth relations.
    - Assess emergent physical reasoning from joint visual-text training.  
    The project benchmarks GPT-4o’s predictions against depth estimation baselines to evaluate generalization capacity.
