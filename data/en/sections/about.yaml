summary: >
  I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), supervised by [Lijie Hu](https://lijie-hu.github.io/).
  My research focuses on Explainable AI (XAI) and controllable generative models for biological research, including protein design and biomolecular modeling.
  I have worked extensively on AI applications in biology, from spatial transcriptomics analysis to AI-driven protein affinity design, 
  as well as industry collaborations on large language model–powered analytics.
