  abstract: "Protein language models (PLMs) frequently collapse into pathological repetition during generation, which undermines structural confidence and functional viability. We present a systematic study of repetition in PLMs and propose Utility-Controlled Contrastive Steering (UCCS), which steers generation using contrastive sets that maximize repetition differences while controlling structural utility. Across ESM-3 and ProtGPT2 on CATH, UniRef50, and SCOP, UCCS reduces repetition without retraining while preserving foldability-related confidence."
